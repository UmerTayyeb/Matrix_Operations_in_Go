# Matrix_Operations_in_Go
This repository contains a simple Go program that performs basic matrix operations such as addition and multiplication. 
The program showcases how to implement these operations on two-dimensional slices in Go.

Features:
Matrix Addition: The program demonstrates how to add two matrices of the same size and displays the resulting sum matrix.
Matrix Multiplication: It also showcases matrix multiplication, illustrating how to multiply two matrices and generate the product matrix.

Usage:
Modify the size variable to set the size of the matrices.
Input the values for matrix1 and matrix2 by modifying the initializations.
The program will compute the sum and product of the matrices and display the results.

Functions:
sumMatrix(matrix1 [][]int, matrix2 [][]int, size int) [][]int: Computes the sum of two matrices.
multiplyMatrix(matrix1 [][]int, matrix2 [][]int, size int) [][]int: Computes the product of two matrices.
printMatrix(matrix [][]int): Helper function to print a matrix.

Why This Repository?
This repository is a beginner-friendly demonstration of matrix operations in Go. 
It can be a helpful resource for those learning Go programming and looking to understand basic operations on two-dimensional arrays.
